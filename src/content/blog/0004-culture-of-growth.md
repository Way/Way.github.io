At fino, culture has always been a topic of particular importance. From the very beginning, our priority has been to empower individuals to take responsibility for themselves. This empowerment is closely tied to mindset, self-confidence, and intrinsic motivation.

Even today, I value determination in candidates and employees more highly than their raw skillset or experience. I believe in learning and discovering together, rather than merely motivating and delegating.

## The "Family" Metaphor

I often hear the phrase "we're a family" in the context of company culture. While I understand the sentiment, I find it somewhat misleading. A family is often defined by blood ties, which can lead to a sense of obligation and dependency. In contrast, I prefer to think of our culture as a "community"—a group of individuals who choose to work together, share ideas, and support one another.

## The Importance of Culture

I believe that a strong culture is built on shared values and principles, rather than just a set of rules or policies. At fino, we have a few key principles that guide our work and interactions:

1. **Involve people early and bring them along on the journey.** Collaboratively visualize ideas and processes on a whiteboard to foster shared understanding and ownership.

2. **Challenge and encourage individuals—not only to help them improve but also to enable them to surpass you.** Often, our own mental barriers and hierarchical thinking prevent others from realizing their full potential.

3. **Mistakes are not only allowed—they are essential.** However, they shouldn't be excessively costly. No one should fear making mistakes, as fear inhibits initiative and independent action. Courage and a strong sense of teamwork fuel individual curiosity and drive.

4. **Recognize that everyone is a human being with their own story, motivations, concerns, and unique traits.** We often focus heavily on technical aspects and overlook the human dimension. Everyone deserves recognition, even if not everyone thrives in the spotlight. It's crucial to identify where each person feels most comfortable, as this significantly influences their growth and performance.

## The Role of Technology

Perhaps my philosophical inclination is particularly evident in this last point. But as someone who deeply values people, I firmly believe that today—more than ever—the true difference lies in individuals, not in technology or AI.
